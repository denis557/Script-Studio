## About
I didn't know what app to create, and then my friend developed his own language interpreted by C++. He wanted to add syntax highlighting for it, but it would be difficult to do in Visual Studio. So, I decided to create a separate IDE for his language (I wanna add support for TypeScript in the future).

## Stack
